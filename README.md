# Ingert

A decompiler for *Trails through Daybreak*, *Trails through Daybreak 2*, *Trails beyond the Horizon*, and *Ys X: Nordics*. It can decompile and recompile every script[^mon9996_c00] with perfect roundtripping.

To use, simply drag a file or folder onto the executable.

[^mon9996_c00]: Except *Daybreak*'s `mon9996_c00.dat`, which has a different format from all the other scripts.
