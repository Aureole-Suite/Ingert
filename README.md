# Ingert

A decompiler for *Trails through Daybreak* and other games that share its engine (*Ys 10*, *Trails through Daybreak II*, *Trails beyond the Horizon*).

For *Daybreak* it can decompile and recompile every script[^mon9996_c00] with perfect roundtripping. The other games are not tested, but I expect them to work as well.

To use, simply drag a file or folder onto the executable.

[^mon9996_c00]: Except `mon9996_c00`, which has a different format from all the other scripts.
